On the current browser page, it shows the receipts for Costco warehouse for a selected 3-month period. By default, it shows “Last 3 Months”. Read all receipts, not just about the date time, total, but also the receipt details (You ought to click the View Receipt button to see the content, then press Escape key to dismiss the content so that you can read other receipts) You are going to show me a data table in CSV format for all receipts with the following columns: order_date_time, total_amount,warehouse_name, item_name, item_code, item_amount, item_note, subtotal, tax, payment_method, total_items_sold, savings. Make sure each row is a purchase item (Never create such rows: SUBTOTAL, TOTAL, INSTANT SAVINGS, TOTAL NUMBER OF ITEMS SOLD, text start with ECO FEE or TPD). So if there are 2 receipts, each receipt has 5 items, then there should be 10 rows. Please also note for each line item such as “457 HOMO MILK 11.78 N”. 11.78 is the amount. N means it’s a normal grocery item. “2458554 TIDE ORIGNL 29.99 B” The ending B means it’s not a food and need to pay tax directly. If there is no ending N or B or Y, just a number, then this is a breakdown of the item, such as the ENVIRO FEE or DEPOSIT . If the row ends with -, such as “1898878 TPD/1548614 3.00-” This means the discount for the previous item. Put everything you know about the purchase item, including the discount/deposit/fee as text in the item_note column, and don’t create new rows for them. The item_note should be something like “TPD/3028018 -20.00 as discount; 0.35 as Eco fee”. Read all receipts in the current page and then generate the CSV. Don’t ask me to review the CSV when you process one receipt. I will review the CSV when all receipt data are there.
