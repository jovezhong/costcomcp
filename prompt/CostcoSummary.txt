On the current browser page, it shows the receipts for Costco warehouse for a selected 3-month period. By default, it shows “Last 3 Months”. This is controlled by a dropdown list between text “Your receipts will appear within 24 hours of the transaction.” and a button “Filter” (never click this button). List the receipts in current period(for “Last 3 Months”), don’t click the View Receipt button, just read the warehouse name, datetime, and total. After you read all receipts, choose each option in the “Showing” dropdown (there are totally 10 options in the dropdown), wait 1 second for the content refresh. You will list all the receipts (from all 10 time ranges) as a single CSV file, with those 4 columns: Date(in the YYYY-MM-DD format, sort by this column), Time(in 24h format), Location, Total (in number format, without $ symbol)
